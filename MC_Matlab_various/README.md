# Metropolis algorithm in Matlab

##Â Overview

In this folder are Matlab implementations of Metropolis for various systems:
- `diluted_iakl.m` - Ising antiferromagnet on kagome lattice with a selective dilution on the third sublattice
- `iakl_half.m` - Ising antiferromagnet on kagome lattice ($S=1/2$)
- `siakl_half.m` - Stacked Ising antiferromagnet on kagome lattice ($S=1/2$) 

Additionally, there is an implementation of Thermodynamic integration method (`thermodynamic_integration_method.m`).

## Running the code

Each of the files is a script, so just modify the user-defined parameters (most importantly the save directory) as needed and run it in your Matlab environment as any other script. Code is well commented, so it should be easy to understand what it does.
